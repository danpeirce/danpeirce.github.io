<p>Reformatted from <a href="http://danpeirce.net46.net/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=4d_lcd">Dokuwiki</a> on July 21, 2013</p>
<p>4D Systems makes small TFT LCDs with full color, built-in controller, sound,
touch screen and MicroSD-card interface. They package some in kits complete
with serial interface to a raspberry pi. The displays could also be used with
a microchip PIC.</p>
<p>So far I have tested displaying text, reading screen touches and playing back
sound files in the *.wav format.</p>

be connected to these lines rather than what these lines are on the display!</p>

on the back of the display.<br>

<p>Program now responds to touch screen and prints coordinates of touches.</p>

<h3 id="some-details-of-serial-communications-with-the-display">Some Details of Serial communications with the Display</h3>
<p>4D Systems provides C code that can be used to communicate with the display
directly (see <a href="https://github.com/4dsystems/Picaso-
Serial-C-Library/tree/master/C/Include">https://github.com/4dsystems/Picaso-
Serial-C-Library/tree/master/C/Include</a> ) but this was written for a windows
computer and makes of functions not in a standard C library. Rather than try
to modify that code for use on a PIC18F2620 I relied on a different document.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.4dsystems.com.au/downloads/Software/4D-Workshop4-IDE/Docs/Serial/PICASO-SPE-COMMAND-SET-REV1.11.pdf">http://www.4dsystems.com.au/downloads/Software/4D-Workshop4-IDE/Docs/Serial/PICASO-SPE-COMMAND-SET-REV1.11.pdf</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The display module accepts serial commands. These can be sent using the
standard printf() function. This is the approach I am taking. If I want to
send a string to be displayed all I need to do is send something like the
following:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span>&quot;<span class="c">%c%cThis is the string\r\n that will be displayed\r\n%c&quot;, 0x00, 0x18, 0x00);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note that <strong>0x00</strong> followed by <strong>0x18</strong> is the command to display the string
that is coming next and the the <strong>0x00</strong> at the end is a <strong>NULL</strong> character at
the end of the string that tells the display there will be no more characters
for this command.</p>
<p>The display module responds with a <strong>0x06</strong> acknowledgment followed by two
bytes (MSB first) indicating the length of the string displayed.</p>
<p>Note the use of <strong>\r\n</strong> for a carriage return and newline.</p>
<h3 id="wait-for-the-acknowledgment">Wait for the Acknowledgment</h3>
<p>The 4D Systems documentation states that it is important to wait for the
acknowledgment of one command before sending another. The initial code I have
been writing for the PIC18F2620 makes use of blocking code that would not be
appropriate when multitasking. My goal at this point is simply to explore the
use of the display. In this scenario a blocking printf() statements are OK. On
Microchip PIC18F devices the printf() does not return until all but the last
two bytes of the message string are sent.</p>
<p>The PIC18F devices have a two byte output buffer in hardware. The default
printf() returns after the last byte is sent to the buffer and before the last
byte is sent from the USART. This is important in that even with blocking code
one has time to start listening for the acknowledgement before it could
possibly be sent (it won't me missed).</p>
<p>The PIC18F device also has a two byte hardware input buffer.</p>
<h3 id="adding-sound">Adding Sound</h3>
<p>The 4D Systems display can play back sound files in the <strong>wav</strong> format. The
display kit cam with a blank 2GB microSD card. I copied a couple of wav files
onto the card and programmed the PIC18F2620 to play a sound each time the
screen is touched.</p>
<p>One anomaly occurred. When the filesystem is initialized the document says to
expect a 0x06, 0x00, 0x01 response if the file system loads correctly and a
0x06, 0x00, 0x00 if it does not. I got a different response and yet my wave
file did play back. It appears the documentation is older than the firmware in
my display.</p>
<p><strong>more to come...</strong></p>
