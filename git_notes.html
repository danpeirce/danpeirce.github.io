<p>Reformated from <a href="http://danpeirce.net46.net/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=git_notes">Dokuwiki</a></p>
<h1 id="git-notes">Git Notes</h1>
<p>This page is newer than my <strong><a href="git">Git</a></strong> page. That page is essentially notes
that I took as I was having my first run through a basic Git tutorial and the
first weeks of using it. Now that I have a better idea of what git is and how
to use it I thought I would start a new page rather than try to reorganize the
old one (which I may eventually delete).</p>
<p>It is very easy to find information on Git when a question arises simply using
Google. I am finding <strong><a href="http://git-scm.com/book">http://git-scm.com/book</a></strong> an excellent resource. I
have the free epub version of this book on my tablet so I can read it on the
go.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what Git really is see <strong><a href="http://git-scm.com/about">http://git-scm.com/about</a></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="individual-work">Individual Work</h2>
<p>This section is very basic. git is a good tool for collaborative projects but
even in a small project on which someone works alone it git is beneficial. It
allows one to keep a stable working copy of an entire project while working on
new features. It facilitates experimentation because git makes it easy to have
multiple versions of the same project. Files can be changed but if one feels
changes have gone in the wrong direction it is easy to go back to an earlier
version of the project. It is also possible to have multiple branches which
can be merged with the master, discarded or kept for future development.</p>
<h2 id="git-for-windows">Git for Windows</h2>
<p>Git was developed on Linux and has been ported to MS Windows. The Windows port
is beta. There is a Windows GUI for Git but it is not full featured and
documentation is primarily available for the Bash command line interface
(CLI). I have been sticking to the command line interface because the help and
documentation is all for this interface. Also, if one moves over to a Linux
computer (like say the <a href="raspberry_pi">Raspberry Pi</a>) the one will need to know
the CLI. There are not may commands needed for basic Git and one can use a
<strong><a href="http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf">cheat sheet</a></strong> (and/or Google) to help remember commands.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://msysgit.github.com/">http://msysgit.github.com/</a></strong> -- download Git for Windows and install</li>
</ul>
<p>Since Git was written for <strong><a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU/Linux</a></strong> the commands expect to be in a
<strong><a href="http://www.gnu.org/pronunciation/pronunciation.html">GNU</a></strong>
<strong><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a></strong> shell. Git for Windows includes
a Bash shell called MINGW32 (essentially
<strong><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">mingw</a></strong> which provides a minimalist GNU
shell functionality on a windows system).</p>
<p>Once Git is installed on a windows computer it is possible to open the Git
Bash shell: <img alt="" src="git/shortcut.png"></p>
<p><img alt="" src="git/mingw32_window.png"></p>
<p>This may look odd to many MS Windows users, <strong>but don't be put off: it is not
difficult to use</strong>. If one were to use the standard cmd.exe shell on a MS
Windows computer they would get a typical prompt something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">C</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">\</span><span class="n">Documents</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="n">Settings</span><span class="o">\</span><span class="n">Dan</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This shows the current path (where one is in the directory (or folder) tree.
On <strong>MS Windows systems</strong> each drive has a letter designation followed by a
colon. The rest of the path shows the folders and sub-folders down to the
current location in the tree.</p>
<h3 id="in-unix-like-shells-the-organization-is-a-bit-different">In Unix like shells the organization is a bit different.</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unix like shells don't have drive letter designations. Different drives are mapped into the directory system with mount points and there is just one directory tree. To the Bash shell a C: at the beginning of a path does not make any sense. </p>
<ul>
<li>MINGW32 maps <strong>C:</strong> into <strong>/C/</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another difference between MS Windows and Bash is that Bash uses <strong>forward slashes</strong> in the path rather than <strong>back slashes</strong>. See <strong><a href="http://www.linfo.org/forward_slash.html">http://www.linfo.org/forward_slash.html</a></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Bash shell there is a shortcut designation for an individual's "home" directory which is the directory a person finds him/herself in when first logged in. The home directory is designated by a Tilda <strong>"~"</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since GNU/Linux is based on Unix and Unix was developed for Mini Computers not Personal computers there is an assumption that everyone logs in remotely. Before the Path there is an indication of the account user name and computer name that one has logged into. Networking was common for Unix based computers long before it was common for MS PC's.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the path there is a "&gt;" prompt on the MS windows command line. On the Bash command line there is a "$" rather than a "&gt;". </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>More detail at &lt; <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/data/agvf.html">In Unix, what is the shell?</a> &gt;</p>
<h3 id="moving-around-the-file-tree-using-mingw32">Moving Around the File Tree Using MINGW32</h3>
<p>In the example screen shot of a MINGW32 window given up above one can see that
the user name was Dan and the computer name was ELECTRON. One can see that the
path is the user Dan's home directory but the actual absolute path is not
explicit. The Bash command to get the working directory (print working
directory) is <strong>pwd</strong>.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">Dan</span><span class="p">@</span><span class="n">ELECTRON</span> <span class="o">~</span>
$ <span class="n">pwd</span>
<span class="o">/</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">Documents</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="n">Settings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">Dan</span>

<span class="n">Dan</span><span class="p">@</span><span class="n">ELECTRON</span> <span class="o">~</span>
$
</pre></div>


<p>Moving around the file system works essentially the same as with the MS
Windows command console. The command is <strong>change directory</strong> using <strong>cd
{destination path}</strong>. In Bash if one leaves off the destination path they will
got back to their home directory.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-a-usb-flash-drive">Accessing a USB Flash Drive</h3>
<p>Bash under MINGW32 can access USB Flash drives.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell if the the flash drive is added after the Git Bash window
has been opened it make be necessary to close all Bash windows and open a new
one after the USB drive is attached (
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8612751/git-bash-can-not-identify-usb-
flash-drives">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8612751/git-bash-can-not-identify-usb-
flash-drives</a> ).</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">Dan</span><span class="p">@</span><span class="n">ELECTRON</span> <span class="o">~</span>

</pre></div>


<p>The list command can be used to see the contents of the project directory.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ls</p>
<p>Dan@ELECTRON /e/project
$ ls
Functions robot_diagnostic_4002</p>
<p>Dan@ELECTRON /e/project
$ </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One can get more information if the <strong>-l</strong> switch is used.</p>

<p>The <strong>d</strong> at the beginning of the line indicates that <strong>Functions</strong> is the
name of a subdirectory in <strong>project</strong>. robot_diagnostic_4002 is also a
subdirectory. One can find out what is in the Functions directory as follows:</p>

<p>So far this has all been simple Bash commands. For more introduction to Bash
see <a href="http://www.beforever.com/bashtut.htm#pwd">http://www.beforever.com/bashtut.htm#pwd</a>. Google will bring up many
other similar intro's (and/or more in depth information -- a lot of the
information found would be a distraction to what we need at this point).</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-git-repository">Creating a Git Repository</h2>
<p>As stated already a Git <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-
guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf">cheat sheet</a> can be used to help remember the Git
commands.</p>
<p>Let us start with the <strong>assumption</strong> a person has a few local files they want
to start tracking with Git.</p>
<h3 id="basics-from-scratch">Basics (from scratch)</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>launch git bash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>navigate to folder containing files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>git init</strong> command to initialize repository</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>git add * </strong> this adds all the files in the folder to the repository</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>git commit -m "first commit" </strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That is the very simplest set of commands required to set up a repository.</p>
<h3 id="variations">Variations</h3>
<h4 id="setup-author">Setup Author</h4>
<p>One thing a person might want to also do is specify their name and email
address before doing the initial commit in case the repository is put on a
remote repository at some point.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>git config --global user.name "Your Name" </strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>git config --global user.email you@example.com</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="setup-gitignor">Setup .gitignor</h4>
<p>Often it is desirable to ignore some file types so that they will be left out
of the repository. A simple .gitignor file that I have used for MPlab C18
projects contains the following:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="o">*</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">cof</span>
<span class="o">*</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">o</span>
<span class="o">*</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">hex</span>
<span class="o">*</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">map</span>
<span class="o">*</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">mcs</span>
<span class="o">*</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">err</span>
<span class="o">*</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">mcw</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This ensures only the source files, .gitignor file and project file will be
included in the project. One does not want any of these other file types
tracked in the repository.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Git works best with text files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is easy to regenerate those other files from the source files using MPlab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saving those files in the repository would waste space, waste time and complicate the process of merging branches.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Having the project file in the repository is a good idea because it is a text
file and it contains a list of files that should be included in the project.
The list may change and grow as the project changes and grows which means
tracking this file is very helpful.</p>
<h3 id="obtaining-existing-repository">Obtaining Existing Repository</h3>
<p>Often one does not start from scratch but pulls in work from others. This
document should help one get started.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/everyday.html">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/everyday.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That file is one of many that will be installed on a <strong>Debian Linux</strong> system
if one installs the <strong>git-doc</strong> package. On my system <strong>everyday.html</strong> is in
the <strong>/usr/share/doc/git-doc</strong> directory along with many other documentation
files.</p>
<p>If one just wants to clone a repository from a place like bitbucket it is very
simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>navigate to a new folder where you want the project to go</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from git bash type the following (as an example)...</p>
<p>git clone https://bitbucket.org/danpeirce/apsc1299labs.git</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This will set up a local repository with the complete apsc1299labs project.
This would be useful for APSC1299 students. At this point everything could be
done locally unless there is a change on the server that students would then
want to <strong>fetch</strong> or <strong>pull</strong>.</p>
<p>For more information on the apsc1299labs project see</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/danpeirce/apsc1299labs/overview">https://bitbucket.org/danpeirce/apsc1299labs/overview</a></li>
</ul>
