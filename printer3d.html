</ul>
<p>It is pointed out in the Calibration Manual that there are settings for the 
software that control things like</p>
<ol>
<li>The shell thickness</li>
<li>The amount of fill</li>
<li>the fill pattern</li>
</ol>
<p>These settings can be adjusted. For example the default fill is only 10%. This 
conserves both material and the time it takes to print. It means there will be 
voids in an otherwise solid part and that one does not need to put these voids
in the 3D model.</p>
<p>It is also possible to turn on a feature that will automatically create 
supports for any parts with extreme overhang (more than 50 degrees). Presumably these
supports can be broken off after the part is complete. I would take this to mean that
parts can be quite arbitrary in design and easily include assembly tabs.
for places that have extreme overhang.</p>

<li>This software was developed for modelling parts to be printed on a 3D printer. It

  writting a script that defines cubes, cylinders and other basic shapes that can be 
  combined for the custom part.</li>

<p>There is a part we require for ASTR1100. I have put together our new photometers for Richmond. I still need a fitting to connect the sensor tube to the support rod. I decided try making a 3D solid model of the part as I envision it. Currently I have two versions.</p>
<p><img alt="First Part" src="cylinders.png" title="First Part" /></p>
<p>After reading more on 3D printers and thought I should change the design to make a stronger 
part. Keep in mind that in general that to keep costs down 3D parts are most often printed as 
a shell with less dense fill. The area interior to the shell is typically made much less dense by including voids. Also I have read that the parts tend to be weakest in the Z direction since the shell and fill are built up one layer at a time. The part essentially ends up as multiple layers laminated together. </p>
<p>The new model looks as shown in these photos</p>
<p><img alt="Fitting for Photometer" src="support_astr1100.png" title="Fitting for Photometer, ASTR1100" /></p>
<p>Also, added some text to the object.</p>
<p><img alt="Fitting with KPU Message" src="support_astr1100_kpu.png" title="Fitting with KPU Message&quot;, ASTR1100" /></p>
<p>I also exported a cutaway view of the part which allow all the features to been seen together.
The extra new holes should help to provide support for the shell of the support rod hole.
These holes are sized to accept a #4-40 machine screw.</p>
