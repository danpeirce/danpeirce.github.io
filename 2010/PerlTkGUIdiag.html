<br>Largely on my own time I have written a Perl/Tk script to interact
with the Robot Diagnostic Program that runs on the sumovore robots.
<br>Perl and Tk are available for free and together allow one to produce
a simple graphical interface without a great deal of effort. I had previously
worked with Tcl/Tk but find I like Perl much better since it has a syntax
more like C than Tcl does. I opted for the Strawberry Hill distrubution
of Perl which allows one to make use of the Perl modules at CPAN.
