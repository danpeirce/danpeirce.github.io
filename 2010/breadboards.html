<br>The following is related to the output on pin 14 in part A of lab 5
(page 28 of 2009 lab manual).
<p>Some of the limitations of solderless breadboards are discussed at
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard#Limitations">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard#Limitations</a>
<p>There is a discussion of contact resistance and stray capacitance along
with the recomendation that solderless breadboards not be used above 10
MHz.
<br>This gives some indication of why one will not get an ideal looking
waveform from OSC/4 output pin 14.
<p>I have not set it up but one could look at the difference between the
output on pin 14 of a PIC in a breadboard and a PIC not in a breadboard
(solder some wires directly to a 40 pin solder socket or directly to the
pins of a PIC).
<p>Also may want to comment on the loading effect of the scope and the
reason to use a x10 scope probe.

<p>By the time they do lab 5 they may have covered an RC circuit in physics
1220 in which case they may recognize the round of the pin 14 waveform
as looking something like the output from an RC circuit.
