<br><font size=+2>Overview</font>
<br>The purpose of the Robot Diagnostic program is primarily to test the
correct functioning of the different parts of the robot. The students often
add new code to their programs and find the robot stops working in ways
they don't think are related to their new code. It is nessesary to have
a program that can test all aspects of the robot to ensure it works. That
is the puropse of the diagnostic program. It was designed to be easy to
use by students, lab instructors and technicians.
<p>The program was written to be used with hyperterminal
<blockquote>(although I have also written a Perl/TK script that includs
a GUI and can be run on a PC that has Strawbarry Hill Perl installed [as
well as the following perl modules Tk and Win32::SerialPort] ---- note
that Tk must be compiled and installed and this takes some time -- more
at&nbsp; <a href="PerlTkGUIdiag.html">PerlTkGUIdiag.html</a>&nbsp; ).</blockquote>
The robot is connected to a PC with a simple passive cable. The program
uses a menu system that is easy to navigate.</blockquote>

<br>Significant changes to <a href="robot_diagnostic4002/main.c">main.c
</a>were
made for version 4.001 (4.002 fixed a bug). The state machine for the menu
system has been retained but it is now the default state of a more encompassing
state machine. The function pointer for the new robot diagnostic state
machine is called diagnostic_state and as of this version of the program
it can point at one of the four possible states. The <a href="MenuStateMachineDiagnosticProgram.html#get_command">function
pointer concept </a>is presented in some detail with regard to the menu
system function pointer. The idea is the same here.

<p>The <a href="MenuStateMachineDiagnosticProgram.html"><font size=+1>menu
system</font> runs within the process_command state</a>. The menu system
must be in the motor menu1 state in order for the jog option to be available.
Restructuring the program in this way should permit the addition of other
non menu driven states. For example the simple line follower program itself
could be added as a new state of the diagnostic program.
<p>Note that the ovals in the state transition diagram indicate program
states. The arrows indicate possible state transitions. The letters adjacent
to the arrows indicate a keyboard press in hyperterminal (or a graphical
button activated by a mouse press if using the Perl/tk GUI). The arrow
without a letter indicates an automatic state transition.
<p>The jog1 and jog2 states both themselves contain a series of sequential
sub-states.
<p>Before the diagnostic state machine is started an initialzation function
from sumovore.c is run. As part of the initialization of the robot hardware
flags are read to determine what type of reset has occured. More on this

<br><b>Version 4.001</b> of the Robot Diagnostic program now allows one
to stop the jog cycle using either a "u" or a "U" on the PC keyboard. It
also allows one to switch from a jog1 sequence to a jog2 sequence by typing
a "2" (one can switch back by typing a "1". At the moment the difference
between jog1 an jog2 is only in the motor speed. jog2 is at full speed
while jog1 is a medium speed.

<br>An updated version of the diagnostic program will be coming soon for
two reasons.
<ol>
<li>
The existing jog sequence created BrownOut Resets on version 1.0 robots
before I started added an extra 22 microFarad capacitor to the output of
that regulator. Now this capacitor is in place it appears a different jog
sequence is more likely to cause trouble.</li>

<ul>
<li>
The output of the regulator was somewhat unstable when it lacked a large
capacitor near the output pins. This problem showed up at medium speed.
It seems plausible the reason was the PWM created a lot of edges and the
transients associated with those edges feed the instability in the regulator.</li>

<li>
With the instability fixed BORs are not happening with fresh batteries.
As the batteries become depleted the chances of the Low Voltage Detect
being activated becomes greater. The event most likely to cause this is
having both motors reverse direction at the same time (this draws a lot
of current). This could be tested for with a Jog sequence that runs the
motors at full speed and allows the motors to obtain full speed before
reversing. The new version of the program will probably have two or more
jog sequences.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<li>
The changes to sumovore.c and interupts.c should be incorparated into the
simple curve follower project. In that project the need for further tweeks
to sumovore.c are apparent and it would be best to have only one sumovore.c
file so that will result in further small changes in the diagnostic project.</li>
</ol>
At the moment I have the sense that we can avoid the addition of a extra
battery for the brainboard. Additional testing would be helpful to see
how much difference it would make. I suspect that it would allow the use
of more depleted batteries but the question remains of how useful that
would be. Would it be worth the addition of the extra battery?

<br>On April 22 a new feature was added to the diagnostic program that
is intended to find a value for the threshold that will ensure the line
can not be lost between two sensors. (this works well on the Richmond robots
with adjusted sensor resistors but not on the Surrey robot I tested).

<br><font size=+1>Perhaps I should make clear that I have concluded that
optical isolation is </font><u><font size=+2>not</font></u><font size=+1>
needed in our case. I also don't expect an additional battery will be needed.
Those ideas are discussed below but the result of that investigation was
to add a capacitor to the mainboard of version 1.0 robots and to enable
features already built into the microcontroller to improved reliability.</font>
<p>In my experience optical isolation is typically used when:
<ol>
<li>
interfacing to AC circuits.</li>

<li>
in industrial installations in which it might be possible for control wiring
and power wiring to be accidentally shorted together in a mishap.</li>

<li>
when the wires are very long (meaning they go beyond the interior of a&nbsp;
single building).</li>
</ol>
I believe that the motor driver IC provides sufficient isolation in our
case with small PM motors and very short wires. <b>This is in regard to
the quote of Mazidi, Mckinlay and Causey down below! These issues were
investigated and I think we can now put them to rest.</b></td>

<font size=-1>It has been found that brown out conditions can be created.
An extra battery was added so that the PIC had a separate 5v supply but
the brownouts persisted (prior to June this had only be tried on version
1.0 robots -- <b>added June 17, 2010</b>). The next step is to add optical
isolation between the PIC and the motor driver IC (the L293D). It appears
this can be done without modifying the existing boards if new boards are
added between the mainboard and Brainboard. (it does not now seem that
is will be necessary!!! -- <b>added June 17, 2010</b>)</font>

<tr>
<td><font size=-1><b>(rev. May 14, 2010)</b> The plan that was outlined
in the box shown below is starting to seem like too much work. Last night
I thought of an alternate plan which would require fewer optical isolators
(just 3 rather than 6) and would require no further changes to the existing
robot or brain board 2! One would add circuits and a battery to an expansion
board available from microchip.</font>
<p><font size=-1>In this scenario the PIC on the brain board would continue
to control the robot as before; however, the student program would be run
in a second PIC on an add-on board. The add-on board would have it's own
power supply and would connect to the brain board through optical isolators
so it would in fact be completely electrically isolated from the robot!</font>
<p><font size=-1>The PIC on the brain board v2 would have just one reliability
feature enabled; the watchdog timer would be enabled. This would mean that
if the program running on this PIC stopped executing the code in the normal
way the watchdog timer would time out causing the PIC to reset and so reenter
a known state. This would occur in the order of 30 to 40 ms.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font size=-1>I have found that if I enable the brownout reset the resets
occur to frequently with the existing setup. The brownout circuit must
be sensitive to conditions that actually only rarely cause the PIC fail.
This can be tolerated except when it is important not to lose any values
stored in RAM. On reset all values in RAM are lost. This is not important
with regard to the low level control close to the hardware as long as the
condition does not persist for too long. It is only on the order of 30
ms I think this would hardly be noticeable as long as it does not happen
too frequently.</font>
<p><font size=-1>At a higher level one must maintain flags and other variables
regarding if the robot has recently seen a line off to the right or the
left. In the case of a maze one would keep an internal map of the maze.
No resets can be tolerated. If the higher functionality was maintained
in a PIC completely isolated from the electric EMI of the motors is should
be robust and reliable.</font>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><font size=-1>(rev. May 18, 2010)</font></b>
<br><font size=-1>Having looked at using the <b>I<sup>2</sup>C</b> interface
or the <b>RS232</b> interface I have decided it would be simpler to use
the <b>RS232</b> interface although this will require the addition of one
jumper to the version 2 brain board.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font size=-1>Using the <b>I<sup>2</sup>C</b> interface would not have
required any change to the version 2 brain board; however, it would be
much more complex to build an isolation circuit given the bi-directional
nature of the <b>I<sup>2</sup>C</b> interface lines.</font>
<p><font size=-1>From a softward point of view the <b>RS232</b> seems more
straight forward. The purpose of <b>I<sup>2</sup>C </b>is to allow a microcontroller
to talk to several peripherals over the same two line interface. That adds
complexity that is not required here. For example the <b>I<sup>2</sup>C</b>
message includes an address so the specified peripheral will respond. The
microcontroller is the master and the peripherals are slaves (they only
send information reqested).</font>
<p><font size=-1>The intent of <b>RS232 </b>is more our actual situation.
We will have two microcontrollers talking to each other peer to peer. <b>RS232</b>
will allow messages to be going in both directions at the same time. This
will allow the software to be simpler. The complication is the built in
level shifting interface intended to let the brain board talk to a PC.
That can be worked around. For example the expansion board can be removed
when the diagnostic program is being run on the robot.</font></td>

layout with shorter ground traces. see <a href="http://www.kwantlen.ca/science/physics/faculty/dpeirce/notes/sumovore_maintenance_log/sumovoreVersions.html">http://www.kwantlen.ca/science/physics/faculty/dpeirce/notes/sumovore_maintenance_log/sumovoreVersions.html</a></font>

<p><font size=-1>I guess the question then would be is the isolation still
necessary with version 1.1 of the robot (it may be a lot easier to simply

<a NAME="LVD"></a><font size=-1>Low Voltage Detect</font></h3>

<center><img SRC="R10_6-2.png" HSPACE=3 VSPACE=3 BORDER=3 height=196 width=468></center>
<font size=-1>When I ran tried the jog sequence on a <b>new version 1.1
robot with old batteries</b> I found I started to get low voltage detection
when the total voltage on the batteries was drained to about 6.1 volts.
Initially the voltage was higher but after 3069 jog cycles the batteries
had discharged down to 6.1 volts and the LVD's started to occur. Initially
they were occurring every 200 or so jog cycles. As the batteries continued
to discharge the frequency of LVD's increased.</font>
<p><font size=-1>There is a significant <b>difference between the LVD and
the BOR</b>. <strike>The voltage difference between the two is small.</strike>
The LVD causes an interrupt. The interrupt service routine turns off most
of the IO of the PIC as quickly as possible in an attempt to slow down
the voltage drop. <strike>If a BOR occurs it means there was insufficient
time to avoid having the voltage drop to the BOR level. If a LVD is indicated
then the interrupt service routine was able to avoid a BOR by turning off
the motors (and LED's). This means the BOR is an indication of a large
<b>dV/dt</b>
and a LVD is an indication of a smaller <b>dV/dt.</b></strike></font>

If a low voltage condition last longer than T<sub>BOR</sub> then a BOR
condition exists. The datasheet gives only a minumum value for T<sub>BOR</sub>

<font size=-1>It appears that changing the layout for the version 1.1 robot
reduced the <b><strike>dV/dt</strike></b>&nbsp; [<b>correction</b> ---
repaced dv/dt with duration] duration that the PIC sees a low voltage condition
on the 5 volt supply. I'm guessing that on the ground lines the high current
path to the motor controller and the low current path to the PIC was separated
so that noise on the ground of the high current path would have less effect
on the PIC and the brainboard in general. Also, it is possible the the
location of the large filter capacitor is more effective on the version
1.1 board.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font size=-1>I have had a close look at the layout of the version 1.0
and version 1.1 boards and <b>it appears that the version 1.1 board has
a smaller dv/dt because the 1000 micro farad capacitor C1 is connected
very close to the output of the regulator.</b> On the version 1.0 board
the capactor C1 is a long way from the regulator and the motor driver is
between (a bad layout). See <a href="http://www.kwantlen.ca/science/physics/faculty/dpeirce/notes/apsc1299/2010/mainboard/ground_layout.html">http://www.kwantlen.ca/science/physics/faculty/dpeirce/notes/apsc1299/2010/mainboard/ground_layout.html</a></font>
<p><font size=-1>In the image below black indicates a highlighted ground
trace on the component side of the board. Gray is a highlighted trace ground
trace that is on the solder side of the board (dark gray is a trace I could
see -- light gray is a trace I am guessing must be there -- I'm guessing
because I don't currently have access to one of these boards that does
not have a bracket obscuring where I think the trace most likely is and
the manual is no help because it does not show the solder side of the new
board; the solder side photo is clearly the old 1.0 version board).&nbsp;</font>

<font size=-1>Bob brought over a robot from Richmond today. I used the
diagnostic program to look at readings from the sensors. I found the sensors
on that robot were saturated as I would expect. The automatic threshold
selection option of the diagnostic program will not work with the highly
saturated sensors. I tried setting the threshold manually and found with
a setting of 35 the line could not be lost between any two sensors but
with a setting of 40 it could be. The setting for the calibrated richmond
sensors typically is between 450 and 512 and the automatic setting procedure
works.</font></td>

<td><font size=-1><b>(prior to May 14) </b>Solarbotics calls the controller
board a brainboard and I have been doing the same. I am considering starting
to call it the PIC board or microcontroller board.&nbsp; The new boards
could be called isolation boards 1 and 2. It seems two boards will be needed
because the connectors to the mainboard need to be in the same relative
position as the connectors to the PIC board.</font>
<p><font size=-1>The plan is <b>(was prior to May 14 -- it was noted on
May 14 that this would be too much work hardware wise -- see alternet plan
May 14 and 18 above -- note as of June 15 this has not yet been implemented)</b>
to make the <b>isolation</b> between the main board and the PIC board as
compleate as reasonably possible. Motor control outputs will go to <a href="../../../../../engineering/APSC1299/files_for_lab/PC942J00000F.pdf">optical
isolators</a>.</font>
<blockquote>
<li>
<font size=-1>The five volt supply for the LED's will come from the PIC
board independed supply.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>The supply for the sensor side of the IR refective sensors
will also come from the PIC board supply.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=-1>The IR emitters will be supplied from the main board supply.</font></li>
</blockquote>
<font size=-1>The one point where isolation will not be complete is the
IR emitters and IR sensors share a common ground. This would not necessary
but the sensor board is designed such that there is a copper trace directly
between the IR emitter and IR sensor under each IR reflective sensor.&nbsp;
The only way to separate these would be to make a new replacement boards.
I think we should be able to tolerate the point of contact between the
two supply systems without getting Brownout conditions since it will be
the only point of contact. I am considering running a ground wire from
the sensor board to the PIC board to provide the return path for the sensors.</font>
<p><font size=-1>I should test the new version of the main board to see
if the brownout reset is an issue with it as well. I have been testing
on Robot 07 (version 1 robot) because that was the one I was testing on
back in 2008.</font></td>
