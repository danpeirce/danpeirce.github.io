<a NAME="State transition diagram"></a>State transition diagram</h3>
The state transition diagram for the menu system of the Robot Diagnositc
Program (with version 2.0 of the brainboard) is shown below. To avoid having
the diagram get too complex it has been separated into a sequence of diagrams.
T<b>his page has been modified to reflect version 4.002 of the diagnostic
program.</b>

<blockquote>The ovals represent states of the menu system for the diagnostic
program.
<p>The lines with arrow heads represent a transition from one state to
another and the reason for the transition. In most cases the reason is
a key press. In most cases a new menu will be printed when the transition
is made. For many keypresses the menu system stays in the same state but
something else happens (could be text displayed in hyperterminal an/or
an input/output change). There is not enough room on the diagram to list
out the input output changes so I will make tables of lists of these changes.
Rather than using hyperterminal it is also possible to use a GUI in Perl/tk
and use mouse button clicks rather than keyboard enteries. Some screen
shots of the GUI window are shown just to give a idea of what that option
looks like.
<p>The program has been changed to accommodate two independent jog sequences.
The jog sequences differ from other pre-existing states in that they run
an ongoing sequence of changes in motor direction until stopped and send
a message with a jog count for each cycle in the sequence. Each jog sequence
justified a new module so any changes in that jog sequence could be made
independent of the other jog sequence. In the menu system the jog sequences
can be thought of as <b>sub-states of Motor Menu 1</b>. Within the actual
program structure the menu system has in fact become the default state
of a <a href="robot_diagnostic.html#encompassing_state_machine">more encompassing
state machine.</a> The jog sequences are not primarily driven by the menu
system but by timing considerations. The new encompassing state machine
is comprised of the following states:

<h3>
<a NAME="state machine"></a>Menu system (state machine)</h3>
When the robot is reset (by a power up or by the PICkit2) the menu state
machine starts in the state <b>"Top Level Menu"</b>. A key press of&nbsp;
an "<b>M</b>" (either case) causes a transition to the state <b>"Motor
Menu 1"</b>. A new menu is displayed so that from that state one can choose
which motor to control (left or right). If "<b>L</b>" is choosen the menu
system will transition to the "<b>Left Motor</b>" state. A new menu is
displayed showing the possible actions at this point. None of the transistions
to this point have included a change in input or output (apart from the
USART). The <b>printf()</b> statements that comprise the actual messages
displayed can be seen at&nbsp; <a href="robot_diagnostic4002/menu.c">menu.c</a>
.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The C functions that correspond to all the states in the state
diagram given above are in the file&nbsp; <a href="robot_diagnostic4002/process_command.c">process_command.c</a>

and the following functions:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Each of those functions is passed a character. In most cases
the character is a character receieved from the PC (via the USART). In
the case of the automatic_threshold** functions they are simply passed
a null character that is ignored. That is because the transition out of
those functions is primarily based on sensor input and not on keyboard
input. A flag variable <b>auto_mode</b> is used to keep track if the system
is in automatic threshold mode. This can be thought of as a parallel state
variable which indicates if the current state is one of the automatic_theshold**
states or not.
<p>Each of those functions returns a value of type <b>enum commands</b>.
The command will be either null (a zero) or a value from the list give
in&nbsp; <a href="robot_diagnostic4002/command_list.h">command_list.h</a>
. The <b>commands are used to set the speed and direction of one of the
motors or to get a signal ADC value from one of the sensors</b>. The list
is in an <b>enum declaration</b> and can be easily expanded.
<h3>
<a NAME="get_command"></a><b>get_command </b>variable (is a fuction pointer)</h3>
A variable called <b>get_command</b> is used to keep track of the current
state of the menu system. Since there is a one to one corraspondance between
states and functions used to implement states the variable <b>get_command
</b>contains
the <b>address of the function</b> that will be called. This means that
<b>get_command</b>
is a pointer to functions. <b>It is very easy to use!
</b>To change the
state a simple assignement statement is used like:</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><b><tt>get_command = get_command_char1;</tt></b></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>When it is time to call the function pointed to by get_command
any of the following can be used:</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><b>get_command(data_rec);</b>
<br><b><tt>or</tt></b>
<br><b>command = get_command(data_rec);</b>
<br><b>or</b>
<br><b>get_command(0);</b></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>The function call with a function pointer syntax looks just
like a normal function call. The pointer name is used in place of a fuction
name.</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>The declaration of the function pointer looks like this:</blockquote>

that it points at the function get_command_char1 (the function for the

This fucntion is called from <b>main()</b> in <b>main.c</b>.&nbsp; It is
the only function in the project that makes fuction calls using the function
pointer <b>get_command</b>. It is in the file <a href="robot_diagnostic4002/process_command.c">process_command.c</a>&nbsp;
Since process_commend() is short I can include the whole function here.</blockquote>

<ul>
<blockquote >Normally <b>auto_mode</b> is <b>zero</b>. In that case a check
is made to see if the USART has a character to interpret. If not the fuction
returns a null as a command.
<br>If the USART does contain a character it will be copied into <b>data_rec</b>.
If <b>data_rec</b> contains anything but a null character then the function
pointed to by <b>get_command</b> will be called and passed the value of
<b>data_rec</b>.
A command is returned and assigned to the variable <b>command</b>. The
command is returned to <b>main()</b>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When <b>auto_mode</b> is <b>1</b> the system is in the process
of automatically finding a good value for threshold. The states involved
in that process primarily get input from the sensors rather than from the
USART. In this case the function pointed to by get_command is called regardless
of the current state of the USART. The function pointed to by get_command
will be passed a null character which is just a dummy value. Those function
only return a null value so the return value is ignored. The variable command
is initialized as "null" and if not changed the <b>"null"</b> command will
be returned to the calling function (always <b>main()</b>).
