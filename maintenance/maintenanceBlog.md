* Modifed newer Learning Ladders to secure base

* Stephanie found one of the AC to 12V DC adaptors  was intermittent. This could also cause the issue Don described last night. 
  Some of these have been opened and repaired in the past. Currently these are low cost items not worth repairing. Especially 
  if opening the box requires a dermal.  New adaptors will be CSA or cUL approved and high efficiency models. Modifying the 
  adaptors voids the approval.
* The other issue with these power adaptors and Pasco that has been a long time irritant is that they use a mono phone plug 
  rather than a mostly standard barrel connector. Phone plugs should not be used for power because if they are inserted only 
  part way then can cause a short. We have been using the existing adaptors for years (perhaps a couple decades) but this 
  device would be more reliable if we got new supplies and replaced the existing sockets with barrel sockets.

Iâ€™ll try a few of the following parts and see how they work out with the existing controller.

* 993-1232-ND AC adaptor
* CP-065A-ND socket

* I have gone around the lab and replaced all ten of the o-rings after getting you e-mail. There was noticeable wear on them. 
  Uneven wear was likely the crux of the issue. At least it could make the speed variable.
* There is one apparatus where I added a shim to raise up the motor arm and drive wheel as it was very low on the rotating disk.
