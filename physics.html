<br />Physics is the study of how reality works; it can tell you why the sky is blue, what light is, and how our universe formed. <br /><br />The appeal of physics is more than just the joy of understanding the world we live in, however. Physics also fuels the amazing leaps of human creativity that give us devices like iPods, cell phones, GPS units and more. These innovations exist because someone--a person like you--studied physics and figured out something new about how our universe works. The Physics Department at Kwantlen Polytechnic University invites you to follow in this person's footsteps.<br /><br />We offer a comprehensive package of preparatory, first, and second year University Physics courses that transfer to BC's universities, university colleges and colleges, and to many universities across Canada and the United States. Physics is also going to be a main component in the exciting new B.Sc. degrees being developed here at Kwantlen! Please take a look at our offerings in the <a href="http://kwantlen.ca/calendar/courses/RR-phys.html">Calendar</a>. We provide physics courses at both Surrey and Richmond campuses.<br /><br />If you are not a Science student, but are hungry to understand how physics applies to the world you know (and to earn science or Q credits towards your non-science degree), then check out our Reel Physics: Physics in Pop Culture (<a title="Phys 1112" href="http://kwantlen.ca/calendar/courses/RR-phys.html#phys1112">PHYS 1112</a>) course. You'd never have guessed physics could be this fun!<br /><br />Kwantlen's physics department also offers <a href="http://kwantlen.ca/calendar/courses/RR-astr.html">Astronomy</a> and <a href="http://kwantlen.ca/calendar/courses/RR-apsc.html">Engineering</a> courses.<br /><br />Kwantlen's Applied Science (Engineering) certificate overlaps well with first year engineering at UBC and UVIC. (Courses also transfer on a course-by-course basis to other engineering schools such as SFU, but the overall match may not be as close.) <br /><br />Introduction to Astronomy (<a href="http://kwantlen.ca/calendar/courses/RR-astr.html#astr1100">ASTR 1100</a>) is a fun and eye-opening elective for non-science students who want to learn just how big and spectacular this universe is. Not only will the course give you a new appreciation for the stars, but you'll earn science and Q credits toward your degree. <br /><br />The physics department also offers third year Astronomy electives (<a title="Astr 3110" href="http://kwantlen.ca/calendar/courses/RR-astr.html#astr3110">ASTR 3110</a> and <a title="Astr 3111" href="http://kwantlen.ca/calendar/courses/RR-astr.html#astr3111">ASTR 3111</a>) designed for Bachelor of Arts students and those seeking to fulfill science requirements for an elementary teacher education program. </p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Why take Physics at Kwantlen?</span></p>
<p>Classes at Kwantlen are small, with a maximum of 35 students, and more personal attention from your instructors is possible with such small class sizes. Students who need additional help also have access to peer tutors in Physics and other disciplines at our campus <a title="Learning Centres" href="/learningcentres.html" target="_blank">Learning Centres</a>.</p>
