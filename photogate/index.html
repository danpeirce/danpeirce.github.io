<td>On the 5th I also looked at the circuit inside a new vernier photogate.
The new vernier photogates contain a <a href="Vernier/74HC_HCT132_CNV_2.pdf">74HC132</a>
high speed CMOS quad 2 input nand schmitt trigger. See <a href="Vernier/index.html">photo
of vernier photogate board &lt;link>.</a>&nbsp; I believe the newer technology
in this photogate may work more reliably with our relativily new PCI NI
data aquasition boards than the older technology in the old pasco photogates!
I recomend testing the vernier photogates with our air track setups.&nbsp;

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>The physical dimensions of the new vernier photogate are different from
the old photogates. I have looked at possible ways to mount the new vernier
photogate on our rotational apparatus. See <a href="Vernier/table/index.html">&lt;link></a></td>

and I was able to get the waveforms that show how the load resistor affects
the output of photogate P08.

<td><h2>Erroneous Data</h2>
    I have caught more photogate data. This time I found a photogate that
was <b>consistently causing erroneous data</b> in the photo data using
the picket fence VI (in room 3290 using the air track).

<p>In this instance a load resistor to ground did not help; however, a
1 K pull-up resistor eliminated the false triggers. Waveforms are shown
below for the no load case and the pull up resistor case.

<h2>Interpretation of Results</h2>
<p><b>My interpretation of these results is as follows:</b>
<blockquote>When the photogate is not blocked the output is 5 Volts. When
the photogate is blocked the output is 0 volts. Labview is falsely reading
a the transition from 0 volts to 5 volts as a transition from 5 volts to
0 volts because the signal is not a clean rising edge but both rises and
falls. This means that the first interval is actually the time from the
leading edge of the first tine to the trailing edge of the first tine.
The second interval is the time from the trailing edge of the first tine
to the leading edge of the second tine. Note that the intervals are normally
leading edge to leading edge. This interpretation is suggests that the
first two times would be in the ratio of the tine width to the distance
between the tines. This is the case. Both the times ratio and the width
spacing ratio are about 1 to 2.
<p>The addition of the pull up resistor cleaned up the signal enough that
no more false triggers occurred.
<p>The same photogate did not consistently cause the problem on a different
computer in the other lab on a different day (Oct. 2). I am speculating
that this is because the level at which the NI board reads a transition
varies some what from board to board.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b>This is quite different from what I was looking at in fall of 2005:</b>
<blockquote>The problem I looked in 2005 was primarily the situation in
which only one or a few points were in error there was no consistency from
run to run which points were involved. Some runs had problems and others
did not. In that case noise spikes seemed to be the problem (ie they are
random). In some cases relocated the blowers to the floor and adding power
bars seemed to help. Load resisters seemed to eliminate the problems related
to noise but in some cases the load resistor would cause this systematic
problem to arise. Some stations have load resistors and some to not and
I added them and took them away as the situation required.</blockquote>

<td>The following shows a comparison of photogate accessories. Three types
were looked at: Old Pasco, New Pasco and Vernier. The responses of the
three types are all quite different. I believe more investigation is warranted.
In Richmond we are currently using mostly the old Vernier sensors. If the
signal in transition is too slow or lingers near the transition point too
long false triggering could result. When that lab is free I will collect
more data.&nbsp;
<p>It appears that the <a href="#vernier">vernier photogate</a> is significantly
faster than the pasco photogate but at least one of them goes into intermittent
oscillations.

<h2>
<a NAME="inlab01"></a>This waveform was caught between labs.</h2>

<p><br>This photogate was in room 3265 and was giving some false triggers.&nbsp;
<br>The problem was intermittent and I have not yet caught an actual errant
point. I think it should not be hard to believe that it would not take
much noise on top of this signal to cause a false trigger. The labview
program is normally triggering off the falling edges. A false trigger at
the rising edge would cause an erroneous data point.
<p>I still want to collect a wave that I know occurred for an errant point.</td>

<p>In October 2005 I caught this noise signal at the NI terminal bloxk.
It was induced in to the photogate signal cable from the blower power line
(this is without load resistors -- signal wire intentianally placed close
to the blower power line -- Note that the blowers use a universal motor
which are known to be a source of bad EMI).
