With regard to thermocouples your statement is correct and
linearization is required for good accuracy. The Vernier specification
for their type K thermocouple shows<br>
    <br>
    <b>Typical Accuracy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&ordm;C to
900&ordm;C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2.2&ordm;C<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211;200&ordm;C to 0&ordm;C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 5&ordm;C<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 900&ordm;C to 1400&ordm;C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
15&ordm;C</b><br>
    <br>
Which leads me to believe that Vernier are not concerned with accuracy
for the full temperature range of the thermocouple. If we use the
vernier type K thermocouple I believe it is not linearized.<br>
    <br>
The vernier documentation is not clear on this, but on <a
 href="http://www.vernier.com/til/1440.html">http://www.vernier.com/til/1440.html</a>
it says the sensor can be calibrated with a two point
calibration!&nbsp; (the procedure for the calibration is given on page
3 of <a href="http://www2.vernier.com/booklets/tca-bta.pdf">http://www2.vernier.com/booklets/tca-bta.pdf</a>
).<br>

In the context of the text quoted from the manual up above a thermistor
would likely be an example that the students could more likely
appreciated since the non-linearity is more pronounced and the
manufacturer can supply a relatively simple equation that relates
resistance to temperature (not the high order polynomials that are
supplied for thermocouples).<br>

Just wondering if this section should not be in lab 1 instead of lab 2
since lab 1 is sort of the introduction lab?<br>

If this were included in lab one it could dovetail very well with a
discussion of the resolution of the Analog to Digital conversion. For
example if the students are using the Vernier differential voltage
probe they can calculate the maximum possible resolution of a 12 bit
Analog to Digital conversion because we know the LabQuest mini does a
12 bit conversion.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>there are 2<sup>12</sup> quantization levels.</li>
      <li>The differentail voltage probe is usable between -6 and +6
volts</li>
      <li>The voltage of each quantization level for the differential
voltage probe is <br>
        <img alt="" src="differential_probe_resolution.png" width="185"
 height="116"></li>
      <li>The standard voltage probe has a range of -10 to +10 volts so
it has a resolution of 4.88 mv/level</li>
      <li>the raw 0-5 volt input of the breadboard probe has a
resolution of 1.22 mv/level (input used for the custom static pressure
sensor in new <a href="../waterColumn/StaticWaterPressure.html">lab 3</a>)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>given this resolution one can calculte the resolution of
the pressure as <b>P = 10.87 (V<sub>s</sub>
- V<sub>so</sub>)&nbsp; kPa </b>which implies<b> <br>
P<sub>res</sub> = 10.87*1.22(10<sup>-3</sup>)<br>
          </b><b>P<sub>res</sub> = 0.0133 kPa/level</b></li>
      </ul>
      <li>The current probe ranges from -600 mA to +600 mA so the
resolution is 0.293 mA/level</li>
    </ul>

    <div align="left">For the average digital instrument we use the
manufacturer does not
specify the resolution of the analog to digital conversion but give the
resolution in a different format. For example with our Fluke 117 meters
we are given the following information<br>
    </div>
    </div>
    <b><br>
    </b>
    <div align="center">From Fluke True-rms Miltimeters manual (114,
115, 117)<br>

 border="3" height="659" hspace="3"><br>
    <div align="left">
    <ul>
      <li>looking at the DC Volts 6 V Range they say the Resolution is
0.001 V. In this case the "resolution" has a different meaning than in
the discussion I gave above. This is the resolution to which the meter
reports the voltage. In the "Accuracy" Column they say the accuracy is
0.5% + 2 counts. By two counts they mean 2 times the stated resolution.
This means that actual reporting resolution is 2*0.001 = 0.002 volts.
Looking to fluke documents for some understanding of what this actually
means I find the following statement <br>
        <div align="center"><font color="blue">"Fluke uses a confidence<br>
of 99 %, which corresponds to<br>
2.6 standard deviations on a<br>
normal distribution.</font>"<br>
        <div align="left">So with the A to D discussion up above I was
giving the absolute resolution of a single sample based on the number
of quantization levels. Fluke is not doing that here. The meter take
multiple samples over a period of time and then reports an average
value with 99% confidence. There is always noise in a digital meter and
this causes the ADC readings to fluctuate. Noise is a random
fluctuation
added to the actual signal. If the noise is at least a little bigger
than the quantization levels and averaging is done with enough samples
the reported resolution could actually be better than the absolute ADC
resolution.<br>
