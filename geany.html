<h1 id="geany-ide">Geany IDE</h1>
<p><strong>by Dan Peirce B.Sc.</strong>  last update July 7, 2013</p>
<p>Documentation for Geany can be found at <a href="http://www.geany.org/">http://www.geany.org/</a></p>
<p>It was installed on a <a href="raspberry_pi">Raspberry Pi</a> (running
<a href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Raspbian/Linux</a>) with</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">apt</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">geany</span>

<p>I started with a simple <strong>hello world</strong> program in C. There were no real
surprises with this simple project. Geany worked like a typical IDE. Meaning I
was able to create the project, create a simple c file, build the project and
run the result from within the IDE.</p>

<p>The compiled <strong>hello world</strong> program can now also be run from the command
line. <img alt="" src="geany/hw_from_cli.png"></p>
<p>This shows that our APSC1299/Physics1600 students could create simple programs
that will run on an ARM based Raspberry Pi board with the the knowledge they
gain in their existing courses.</p>
