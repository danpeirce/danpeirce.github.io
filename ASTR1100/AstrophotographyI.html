          <hr size="2" width="100%">Lots of questions come up when
          someone is running this lab for the first time. I'm putting
          together some notes here to help me remember details down the
          road and possibly to help others running the lab for the first
          time.<br>
          <br>
          We use a modified Dynex webcam (modified by Bob).<br>
          <div align="center"><img alt="modified WebCam"
              src="modifiedWebCam.jpg" border="1" height="423"
              hspace="2" vspace="4" width="600"><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          We are using the Live!Cam Center software on Netbooks. <br>
          For the lab we are using the original webcam lens as a dust
          cap for the CCD sensor underneath. The lens can still be used
          with the webcam when it is not attached to a telescope (as in
          some of the images farther down this page).<br>
          <br>
          <div align="center"><img alt="modified webcam with lens"
              src="webCamWithLens.jpg" height="719" width="600"><br>
            <br>
            <div align="left">When the lens is removed the CCD is
              exposed. And this is the way we use the modified webcam on
              the telescope. The lens is mounted in a plastic housing
              that screws into a support on the webcam. When the lens is
              used the webcam is focused by turning the lens housing (we
              use long nose pliers).<br>
              <br>
              <div align="center">The lens in the housing looks like
                this:<br>

          </div>
          <br>
          <br>
          <div align="center"><b>The Live!Cam Center is opened with a
              desktop icon. </b><br>
            Live!Cam Console also opens (but needs to be shut for all
            features of Live!Cam Center to operate)<br>
            <img alt="(image) detop icon of Live! Cam Center"

          <br>
          The photos taken from different groups have different file
          sizes and different resolutions.<br>
          The Live Cam Center software for Dynex webcam allows for
          different resolutions. If a higher resolution is selected it
          will not be possible to fit all the images onto a combined
          image. <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Fergal used a setting of 640x480. </li>
            <li>In the arcsoft collage creator software he used a custom
              paper size of 11x 19in.<br>
              <br>
              <div align="center"><img alt="(image) resolution setting

            </li>
          </ul>
          For future reference I believe it has been recommended in the
          past the the auto-exposure feature be turned off. I think once
          the manual exposure is set is should be kept the same for all
          the images since they are to be fitted together into one big
          image. It makes no sense to have the exposure changing from
          one part of the image to the other (which is what
          auto-exposure would do since different photos have different
          amounts of the black background in the image.<br>

              an issue with condensation on the outside surfaces of the
              telescope. To get clear images the outside of the <b>corrector
                lens (1)</b> must be kept free of condensation.<br>

        <p align="left">On the Live!Cam Console images shown earlier in
          these notes a significant portion of the image was obscured
          with the mounting plastic.This is because the original webcam
          lens used in those photos has a high curvature making it a
          wide angle lens. When the lens is removed and the CCD is
          placed at the focal point of the telescope the light reaching
          the CCD does not come from such a wide angle and the mount is
          not in the field of view. <br>
