<h1 id="summary-of-changes-to-sumovore-and-brainboard-2">Summary of Changes to Sumovore and Brainboard 2</h1>
<p>by Dan Peirce B.Sc.
March 18, 2010 (rev. <strong>Nov. 2014</strong>)</p>
<p>In 2014 a significant modification was made to the Richmond campus robots 
in that that now use four AA lithium batteries. Before 2014 six AA 
alkaline batteries were used.   </p>
<h2 id="the-purpose-of-the-modifications">The Purpose of the Modifications</h2>
<p>The purpose of the modifications listed on this page are each for
one of the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>To make the <strong>robot hardware more reliable</strong>. Reliability is
    essential. It is virtually impossible for the students to have
    reasonable success modifying their programs in a resonable
    amount of time if the robot hardware does not behave
    consistently. The PIC has now being configured to watch for out
    for low voltage conditions.  </li>
<li>To make in circuit programming with the PICkit2 possible.</li>
<li>To make the robots as interchangeable as reasonably possible. A
    program should work equally well on any of the robots (to the
    extent reasonably possible).</li>
<li>To simplify the task of building the robots (i.e. leaving off
    unnecessary components the robot was designed for the
    mini-sumo event and doubles for line following as a secondary
    purpose. We only do line following because it is a better
    programming task. Also, the florescent tube lighting and
    electronic ballast used in our labs can interfere with the IR
    opponent detectors [IR DET1, IR DET2] as the florescent tubes
    age).</li>
<li>To use long lasting Lithium batteries. <ol>
<li>The voltage from the lithium batteries is more consistent 
   than from alkaline batteries. </li>
<li>The robot speed is also more consistent. </li>
<li>This means the time of travel is more consistent.</li>
<li>The motors are actually rated for six volts not nine volts. Using 
   four lithium batteries should extent the life of the motors.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The use of a smaller main battery voltage requires a regulator for 
    the digital electronics that can maintain a regulated output even 
    when the battery voltage drops below six volts. This is why the 
    DC-DC converter is used in place of the linear regulator. </li>
<li>To avoid damaging the track electricians tape covers the bottom of 
    the scoop.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="robot-11">Robot 1.1</h2>
<p><strong>Require new image since two cell battery pack is removed and linear 
regulator has been replaced with DC-DC converter</strong>
<img alt="" src="imageH16.JPG" /></p>
<p>This image shows parts that I am not installing when building the
new version 1.1 robots.</p>
<ol>
<li>IR DET1, IR DET2, LED1, LED2 <em>not needed saves build time</em>
    LED1 and 2 only confuse our students and waste battery
    power.</li>
<li>IC1 removed because it interferes with changes for dynamic
    braking. I leave the socket off to save build time. This IC
    is essential if one were to use the discrete brain board that
    comes with the sumovore but we don't use it. I save those
    parts for other things.</li>
<li>C2, C3, R3, R4 without IC1 they don't do anything <em>I
    leave them off to save build time</em></li>
<li>Linear regulator replaced with DC-DC converter board. <strong>add details</strong></li>
<li>Two cell battery pack from top of main board is removed and replaced 
    with a wire short.</li>
<li>Test point added to main board to check battery level .</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="" src="imageAAV.JPG" /> </p>
<p>This image is actually of main board 1.0 but the
position of Diag1 is about the same on version 1.1 board (just
slightly farther from switch and the Ziptie ref. no longer exists
on the newer board)</p>
<h3 id="sensor-board-on-version-11-robot">Sensor board on version 1.1 robot</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="imageDJB.JPG" /></p>
<p>Note most of the parts left off.</p>
<p>All copper is coated with solder to avoid oxidation. Note IC4 does
not do anything good for us. It just creates some EMI that could
possibly cause spikes on the sensor outputs. LED4 and LED5 just
waste battery power. TP1 is for adjusting 555 frequency and is not
needed.</p>
<h2 id="robot-10">Robot 1.0</h2>
<ol>
<li>Replaced linear regulator with DC-DC converter.
    <img alt="" src="switchmode_regulator.jpg" /></li>
<li>Two cell battery pack from top of main board is removed and replaced 
    with a wire short.</li>
<li>IC1 removed from socket. removed because it interferes with
    changes for dynamic braking</li>
<li>test point added to main board to check battery level</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="" src="imageAAV.JPG" /></p>
<h3 id="sensor-board-on-version-10-robot">Sensor board on version 1.0 robot</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="imageM62.JPG" /></p>
<ul>
<li>IC4 removed. to void unnecessary EMI </li>
<li>LED4 and LED5 removed to avoid unnecessary IR. </li>
<li>
<p>To keep LED3 on mainboard functional to indicate power is on other
parts are added:</p>
<ol>
<li>Q1 is replaced with a 1 Kohm resistor from Collector pad to
    Emitter pad. Note that the NPN transistor would not work
    without the signal from IC4.</li>
<li>Jumpers replace LED4 and LED5.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pic-brainboard-352">PIC Brainboard #2</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="jumpers.jpg" /></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>PIC16F877A is replaced with a PIC18F4525</p>
<ol>
<li>PIC16Fxxx components are not optimized for C while the
    PIC18Fxxxx components are</li>
<li>PIC16Fxxx components have only a 8 level hardware stack while
    PIC18Fxxxx components have a 32 level hardware stack. this
    makes the PIC16Fxxx components much more prone to hardware
    stack overflow problems which is bad when one is encouraging
    students to create functions. Also the printf() function
    itself is a wrapper that calls functions that call functions
    (all in the stdio module). It is easy to exceed 8 levels of
    function calls.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resonator not installed we use the internal osc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I<sup>2</sup>C connector not installed. we don't use it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reset switch not installed instead we use the two holes for our
    programming adapter board see below</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Richmond I change 5 resistors (under the PIC) so that the
    sensors do not go into saturation even above white paper
    (resistors chosen in an attempt to get same response to grayscale
    for each sensor).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two jumpers added for <a href="dynamic_braking/braking.html">dynamic braking</a>. 
    E1 to p13 of P2 and E0 to p15 of P2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a header with wires attached is hot glued under the PIC board to provide a
    connection for programming.</p>
<p>There are four connections between the two boards (see four pins).
The two pins that are 0.4 inch apart fit into the holes where the
reset switch would have been. The two pins close together fit into
the holes for B6 and B7. Those four points are indicated in the
image below.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>New image required since two cell battery pack has ben removed.</strong>

<p>Tape sensor board to front scoop.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="imageLTG.JPG" /></p>
<p>Layer #1 folded over bottom edge of scoop
Layer #2 wrapped around scoop from end to end to keep layer #1
from lifting 
Layer #3 wrapped around sensor board and scopp from end to end to
keep sensor board tight against scoop and to try to keep sensor
board from moving. </p>

<p>New passive cable to be used with version 2 brain board
A simple passive cable is needed to connect between the robot and
the PC COM1 port. Page 13 of the <a href="http://www.solarbotics.com/assets/documentation/solarbotics_sumovore_pic_brainboard_v2.pdf">PIC brainboard V 2.0
manual</a>
PIC brainboard V 2.0 manual shows the connections between the DB9
connector and pins that fit into the brainboard. As suggested I
used a cable from a dead serial mouse for the connector and
cable.</p>
