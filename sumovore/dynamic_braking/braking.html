<br>Dynamic braking involves putting a resistive load or short circuit
accoss the motor terminals. The faster the motor is turning the greater
the braking effect. This has two advantages over driving the motors in
the reverse direction:
<ol>
<li>
No current is drawn from the batteries during dynamic braking. This will
conserve the batteries and will avoid possible unintended resets and unreliable
operation of the PIC MCU. When motors are started they draw a heavy inrush
current. When the motors are driven in the opposite direction two which
they are turning the inrush current is twice as bad.</li>

<li>
With dynamic braking the breaking force is proportional to the speed of
the motor. As the robot comes to a stop the braking also stops automatically.
If on the other hand the motors are driven in the reverse direction one
needs to stop driving them in the reverse direction at the correct time
or the robot would start to move backwards. As is there is no feedback
from the motors to let the PIC know when the robot has come to a stop.
The amount of time the robot needs to stop depends and the speed of the
robot when braking starts. There is not feedback in this system to tell
the PIC what the speed is and the top speed of the robot will depend on
how fresh the batteries are and other factors. This is all problematic
if one uses a specific time period to drive the motors in reverse but is
not an issue if dynamic braking is used.</li>
</ol>

<p><br>As is the Sumovore mainboard is wired in a way that does not allow
for dynamic braking of the motors. I have added jumpers to the PIC brainboard
2 and have not installed the Mainboard IC1 on a new robot. This allows
me to demonstrate the difference between dynamic braking the motors and
letting them coast to a stop. Dynamic braking is achieved here by grounding
both motor terminals at the same time. For this to work the motor driver
IC should remain enabled (speed is set for 100% duty cycle). Since both
terminals of one or both motors are grounded current will not be drawn
from the batteries.
<p>The links below are to two AVI files. One shows the robot spinning and
dynamic braking being used to stop the robot on the line after a spin turn.
The second shows the robot spinnig and coasting to a stop and overshooting
the line. In both cases detection of the line by the left most sensor was
used to indicate it was time to stop the motors.</p>

It is possible to stop the robot by reversing both the motors but it is
very difficult to reverse them and keep them on for the correct amount
of time to that the robot will stop on the line and not move in the reverse
direction. Dynamic braking on the other hand does not have that problem.
This could be helpful in acute sharp turns!
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The first photo below shows a sumovore that was programmed to go straight
ahead full speed until the center sensor detected a line. At that point
the speed was set to zero for both motors; this allows the robot to coast
to a stop. The batteries were fresh.

<br><b>Dynamic braking</b>
<br>(the robot stops much faster -- the sensors have crossed the line but
most of the robot is still behind the line)
<br><img SRC="stop_dynamic_brake.jpg" HSPACE=3 VSPACE=3 BORDER=3 height=523 width=514></center>

<p>The motor driver IC can allow for dynamic braking because it has two
direction control inputs for each motor. On the sumovore IC1 is used to
complement a motor direction control line from the brainboard and provide
the extra control line to the motor driver chip. The PIC microcontroller
on the brainboard has many extra IO pins that are not in use. It is possible
to use two of these IO pins of the PIC rather than IC1 to provide the other
two control lines needed for the motor driver IC. This allows more flexibility
and the possibility of using dynamic braking of the motors.
<p>For the brake to work the two control lines for a motor are made low
and the enable is on 100% dutycycle (full speed!).

The schematics shown above are from the Sumovore manual and the brainboard

am trying to show. The schematic below shows only the motor control lines!
