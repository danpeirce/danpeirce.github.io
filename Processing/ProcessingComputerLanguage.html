<h1>Processing Computer Language</h1>
Notes by Dan Peirce B.Sc.<br>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <div align="left">It would be nice to have a programming
language that would make it real easy to creat a GUI for an interfacing
project. Arduino users do this by making use of a <b>"Processing" IDE</b>.
Since
our
students typically use C for
programming there
microcontroller projects we don't need the wiring/arduino language; we
know how to program
the MCU's in C. <b>It is on the windows side of interfacing that we
would
like something simple. We could use processing for this.</b> It is at
least
worth looking at as I expect one may be able to get projects up and
running faster this way than using <b>Perl/Tk</b> which is method I
have played with.<br>
    <br>
There is also a project for <a
 href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/Android">Processing on Android!</a>
but it is still Beta. (expect bugs in the system for Android for now at
least).<br>

    <center> <b>The frame inserted below displays a random scatter
plot.</b> <br>
The code was written in Processing and exported as a HTML page and Java
applet (the browser used to view it requires a standard Java Plug-in).
This demonstrates that a
program written in Processing can be exported to be included in a web
page. They can also be exported as an Application or run from within
the free IDE. Since this is an
applet and the points have a random placement it will look different
each time the frame is refreshed. (source modified from example from <a
 href="http://www.gwoptics.org/processing/">http://www.gwoptics.org/processing/)<br>

    </center>
At the bottom of the applet frame there are two links. One link is for
the source code that was used to create the contents of the frame and
the other is a link to the Processing.org web site where the Processing
package was downloaded from. This is as it was created from the export
option in the Processing IDE.<br>
    <br>
Processing can be downloaded from&nbsp; <a href="http://processing.org">http://processing.org</a>
as a zip file. One simply extracts the contents of the file and opens
the extracted folder <b>processing-1.2.1</b> (that was the current
stable version as of April 2011). Actual installation is not required!
Just run the <b>processing.exe</b> file in the folder. <br>
    <br>
The current standard package comes with a lot of functionality but not
a package specifically for creating scatter plots. Through on-line
forums I found that I was not the first that wanted a functional
library for creating a plot. <b>Fortunetly other physics minded people
have had the same need and have created a library for this purpose</b>
(it does more too 2d and 3d). This can be downloaded from <br>
    <div align="center"><a href="http://www.gwoptics.org/processing/">http://www.gwoptics.org/processing/</a><br>
    <div align="left">
    <ol>
      <li>Go to the link near the bottom of the page and download
another zip file. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Extract all the files. <br>
      </li>
      <li>The resulting folder should be placed in the libraries folder
in the <b>processing-1.2.1</b> folder. <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
It's that easy. The package has an example for creating a two
dimensional scatter plot. I simply used that example with a few simple
modifications.
    <ul>
      <li>I reduced the total number of points plotted from 100 to 10.
It just looked too cluttered to me.</li>
      <li>I changed the colours in the plot so that it would show black
on white (rather than white and red on black).</li>
      <li>I want to make a few more changes but I might have to read
some of the documentation first.</li>
    </ul>
