<p>The Raspberry Pi foundation has made available a Debian derived Linux distribution that has the same look and feel as Raspbian that runs on the ARM based Raspberry Pi but instead runs on a x86 based processor (PC or MAC). It can be run from a bootable flash drive or installed on the computers hard drive.</p>

<p>I have the Raspberry Pi up and running on a PC desktop. I believe this was the easiest install of a Linux desktop I have done. Often I have used Linux on older machines and chosen a light desktop like LXDE which was not the default for the distribution. This typically resulted in hours tweaking and not getting everything working just as it should. It seems with this version of Debian Stretch the RPi Foundation has done the tweaking and gotten it all right.</p>
<p>I am still having an issue when I boot directly from a flash drive but perhaps loading a flash drive from the Linux environment rather than making it with the win7 utility will solve that issue.</p>

<p>This will have to be resolved as for most people in the department booting from a flash drive will be more convenient than overwriting the hard drive.</p>
<h2 id="gpio-expander">GPIO Expander</h2>
<p>Quoting from the Raspberry Pi Blog:</p>
<pre><code>Use the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi Zero while 
running Debian Stretch on a PC or Mac with our 
new GPIO expander software! With this tool, 
you can easily access a Pi Zero’s GPIO pins 
from your x86 laptop without using SSH, and 
you can also take advantage of your x86 
computer’s processing power in your physical 
computing projects.</code></pre>

<p>This is something I plan to test.</p>
