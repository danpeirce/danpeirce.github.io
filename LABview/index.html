<br>I have started to have a look at the book <i>LabView for Everyone</i>
2nd Ed by Jeffrey Travis. I see section 2.4 discusses RS232. From the perspective
of this book I'd say the photogate boxes we are thinking of making would
be considered RS-232 instruments.

<br>"Serial port communication is also painstakingly slow..."
<br>The validity of that statment depends on the amount of data that needs
to be transfered. The PIC18F4525 can be set up&nbsp; to communicate at
19200 bits per second with would be 1920 bytes per second. I think that
is fast enough for what we will want to do.</td>
