Pololu 3Pi Expansion Wiring and Assembly
========================================

Expansion Board Wiring
----------------------

### Wiring under the XPRESS board.

### Wiring near Expansion Port

### Add Short Jumpers

There are five very short jumpers to add.

### Added 10K Resistors and Mode Switch

{*photo needed*}

### Place Long Pin Headers for Xpress Board

One way to get the Header pins in strait is to place them in the correct
holes in the expansion board and then add the Xpress board. At this
point the Pins are soldered into the Xpress board and not yet to the
expansion board. Note the Xpress board must remain removable to solder
in very long headers for expansion to robot interconnect.

Xpress board added. Photo taken just before soldering long pins.
